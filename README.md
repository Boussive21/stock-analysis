# stock-analysis
#Background:
Steve wants to analyze a group of 12 green stocks to support his parentâ€™s investment decisions. To do so, we decide to design an interactive workbook using Visual Basic Application (VBA) within Excel to provide each stocks annual volume and return on investment (ROI).
Steve wanted to be able to analyze each stock at the click of a button and now wants to expand his research beyond the 12 green stocks.
#Refactoring the Code
To make original better we were asked to create 3 new arrays: -ticker Volumes(12) to hold volume -tickerStartingPrices(12) to hold starting price -tickerEndingPrices(12) to hold ending price

The above arrays store performance data for each stock when a for loop runs analysis on them. The tickers array that contains original establishes a ticker symbol that can be called on for each stock.

The arrays with the ticker array is done by using a variable called the tickerIndex.

Now that we have created these arrays, a Nested for Loops and variables to loop through the data and can be used to complete the analysis.
Advantages of refactoring code
The obvious advantage of refactoring code is that it makes it more efficient if you get it right. Seeing a reduction in time makes the work we do more efficient and makes it easy to go from project to project

#Disadvantages of refactoring code:
A huge risk with refactoring is that your errors may destroy an already working code. As stated in the first week of class saving over and over again is something we need to get in the habit to have previous iteration saved. We had an issue of activating the worksheets again once we added the code to make the second sheet. And changing the equations in the new code work with the old one needed a couple of revisions to fix.
